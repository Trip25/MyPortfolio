# My Portfolio

<p>Hello to anyone reading this, this is my first portfolio which should give you an idea about my skillsets in coding. I do not come from a coding background and have self taught and enrolled in the School of Code Bootcamp. I am currently in Cohort 14 due to graduate in August 2023!</p>

<p>Please don't be shy and contact me if you are interested in collaborating on any projects! Or if you're looking to employ!</p>
